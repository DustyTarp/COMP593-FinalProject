Used script from poke image viewer to split into two parts for downloading and saving the image. First returns the image url response and second saves the image to disk in the specified path
Added image_url variable from the json response
Testing different hashing scripts to try and get the image hash
Fixed the hashing issue and got the hash of the image
Added file size calculator to find size of the file
Created image path function using a regex to get the photo name
Created an if statement and problem solved through testing to get photo to save properly
Had no idea how to have more than one command line argument in VS code so tested through PowerShell 
Double checked logic and tested multiple times referencing the database
Added date of the photo plus date of addition to the database
Added more print statements to the script to provide more information on what in happening as it does
It works, this was a cool project, I spent way to long almost three hours trying to figure out hashing. Thanks Jeremy I enjoyed this.
